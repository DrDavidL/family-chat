1. **Thematic Depth and Complexity:** Elevate the essay's intellectual rigor by deepening the analysis of urban development's environmental implications. How can the thematic exploration be made more nuanced and multifaceted?
2. **Coherence and Flow:** Reorganize the content, if necessary, to ensure a smooth, logical flow of ideas from one section to another, enhancing overall coherence and readability.
3. **Argumentation and Persuasiveness:** Fortify the argumentative stance of the essay. Can you suggest more persuasive arguments or counterarguments that articulate the significance of sustainable urban planning?
4. **Evidence and Citations:** Assess the current evidence used and recommend additional, more compelling sources or examples that could strengthen the essay's arguments. Please ensure that citations follow academic conventions suitable for a sophomore-level college essay.
