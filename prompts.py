2. **Character Details**: If your scene includes characters, specify their appearance, emotions, and actions. Mention clothing styles, age, posture, and any props they might be interacting with.

3. **Atmospheric Details**: Enrich the setting by describing atmospheric elements like lighting, weather effects, and seasonal attributes. For example, the warm glow of a sunset or the chill of a foggy morning can add depth.

4. **Art Style and Techniques**: Specify an art style or particular techniques you want to mimic (e.g., watercolor, digital illustration, impressionism). Mention if you're seeking a specific artist's influence.

5. **Intended Emotion or Theme**: Clarify the mood, emotions, or overarching theme you wish to convey. Whether it‚Äôs serene tranquility or vibrant energy, specify how you want your viewer to feel.

Generate a serene, early morning landscape of the Scottish Highlands during autumn. The scene should include a misty, rolling hillside with heather and bracken in hues of purple and gold. A solitary stag stands silhouetted against the rising sun, which casts a warm golden light over the scene. Incorporate a realism art style, aiming for a detailed and emotive representation that conveys a sense of tranquil solitude and awe-inspiring natural beauty.
